# Chat App
Worked with another frontend devloper to create this chat app. Built with reactjs and material ui.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Reactjs and Material UI
I worked mostly on the interface, routing, contexts and redux part of the app. More work will still be done as i plan on re-building it with framer motion, nextjs and introduce firebase to it.

## Lessons Learned:

Was my first time using material UI and i think i did pretty well. I was able to move from being a beginner at redux to being an expert I'd say. I really had so much fun building this app.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
